# ChessVR
This game takes the classic game of Chess and converts it to a Virtual Reality setting using Unity 2017 and the Oculus Rift.
- The player uses Oculus controls to grab and place pieces
- Moving pieces to a designated "dead" zone increments the score accordingly
- Capturing the king displays a win state
